The code provided in this repository is the part of our course Mastering Salesforce Flows.

“Mastering Salesforce Flows” is a training/workshop course that will get you up and running in
Salesforce Flows from scratch and will turn you into a Flow master. 

Flows is now the present and future of automation in Salesforce. This is arguably one of the most
powerful features of Salesforce. There are different types of Flows (like different tools in a Swiss army knife)
that you can use for different purpose in different situations.

If you have never used Flows, we are going to start from scratch, take the baby steps and build 
our way up to master it. We are going to Crawl -> Walk -> Run & Fly with Flows.

This course comes with free preview and 100% Money Back Guarantee.
